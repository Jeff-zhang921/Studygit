//对于merge conflict
//发生情况:when two person change the same line(area) in the repository
//if changing is at different area it won't conflict


//branching: different version of the code going in same repository 
//git branch show all branch
//git branch  <> create a new branch
//switch between branch use git checkout <>
//git merge combine the branch from the test branch to the master branch
//after merge, master branch will have the history changing that test branch have
//merge two branch by git merge <function branch>
